Uses Firebase as authentication, database, image storage, hosting, and cloud functions. From this project, I learned how to:

- CSR vs SSR and how to interact with both in a Next.js environment
- Manipulate user UIDs to store and send card files
  - How to create separate collections and when to generate unique document IDs vs use custom ones
- Anthentication in server components (as compared to client components)
